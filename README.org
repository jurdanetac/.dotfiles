#+TITLE: Personal configuration files

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="tux.png" /></p>

This is the repository where I store all my program's cofigurations, which I use
on my GNU/Linux machine on a daily basis!

* Instructions for usage
** Clone this repo on your home (~) folder
Get a copy of this repo running this command on your shell:

#+begin_src
git clone https://github.com/jurdanetac/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
#+end_src

** Stow (copy) the directory of the config you want
GNU Stow is an organizer for /usr/local software packages, but can be used for
other organizing tasks. That's the reason of the long, redundant paths

#+begin_src
cd ~/dotfiles

;; manual setup one-by-one ex.
;; mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
;; cp neovim/.config/nvim/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

;; stow one thing:
stow neovim
#+end_src
